When a number is clicked save each value to an array until and operator has been clicked.

Once an operator is clicked save the value of the array to num1, and then check what operator 
has been clicked by assigning the corresponding button to the operator variable. (will change based on what is clicked)


Use an if statement to check what operator is used in order to store num1 to a
second array that is clicked which will be num2.

After the equals sign OR another operator is clicked AFTER num1 and num2 have been assigned,
assign the new variable to num1 and repeat the process.

*** CONCATENIZE THE ARRAY STRING VALUES TO A FULL NUMBER AND THEN PARSE AS AN INTEGER ***
